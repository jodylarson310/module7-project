# module7-project

This is the repository for UTSA Data Analytics Bootcamp - Team 4's Module 7 Project.

The Team 4 Project is a study of concert ticket prices for four musical artists across different genres in four different Designated Market Areas (DMAs).

The specific artist/concert data was compiled from Ticketmaster API.  We encountered some challenges with gathering this data initially due to data limits of 1,000 items per call.  We were only able to gather data for 19 concert events per artist.  We overcame this challenge by isolating the "dmaId" for the common metropolitan areas we chose to cover.

The population and demographics information we used was gathered from the Census Reporter website.

In summary, we found that the Foo Fighters had the most consistent and reasonable prices across all DMAs.  Green Day and Tim McGraw had the highest prices in the Minneapolis/St. Paul DMA, but also offered VIP packages.
